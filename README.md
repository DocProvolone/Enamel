## ðŸ“¦ Installation

You can either compile your own version of the Enamel Expert Advisor, giving you the choice to select how to compile it and modify everything in its logic (using the ` .mq5 ` file in the repository),
or install the pre-compiled `.ex5` Expert Advisors using the instructions below.

### ðŸ“¦ Installing using the precompiled EA


1. Clone this repository or download the `.zip`:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DocProvolone/Enamel
2. Select a version compatible with your CPU
      The EA is compiled for both AVX2 capable processors (a more optimized, faster and more energy hungry version)
      and non-comptabile X64 processors.
      You can check your producer supported instructions set using free tools such as CPU-Z from CPUID (link to official website: https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html)
      If in doubt, or don't want to check your producer compatibility, use the X64 version.
3. Copy the selected EA file (either AVX2 or X64) into your MT5 Experts folder:
   MQL5/Exeprts/
4. Restart MetaTrader 5 (or right-click Navigator â†’ Refresh).
5. The EA will appear under Navigator â†’ Expert Advisors.
âœ… You now have succesfully installed the Expert Advisor! You can check below how to use and optimize it.
